## Business Problem
As one of the world’s leading brewers, AB has a variety of different brands and works with a lot of wholesalers and retailers. One of the leading challenges in serving consumers is to ensure product-availability with wholesalers. Based on market research, when consumers notice their favourite brand is missing from the shelves of retailers, they may quickly make the choice for a competitor’s brand instead.

Hence, it is important to understand the demand of the products in advance. That could help the brewers plan better to have good inventory, would in-turn help the wholesalers have enough stock for the retailers to have customers' favourite products on-shelf!  For example, if the breweries get a high demand forecast for the next few days or weeks, they can ramp up the manufacturing supply accordingly and ensure customer satisfaction and effective sales.

## Solution Approach
Using 5 years worth of weekly sales/demand data, we could try to learn from the trends and signals and build a model to effectively forecase demand for 2 months ahead. We could utilize this model to better plan for future and in-return not only help the wholesalers and retailers ensure availibility of popular products but also ensure customer satisfaction.

**To build an MVP, we would build a forecasting model for 10 products for 8 wholesalers from 2 different states - NY & TX for the next 2 months.**

## Conclusion
**The forecasted values for the next 2 months in the future overall seems to also follow a similar trend that we had observed during EDA across years on average that demand starts to jump in early january and relatively stays consistent. Hence, it feels like the models did a decent job learning from the patterns and signals in the data.**
