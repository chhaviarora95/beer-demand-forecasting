## Business Problem
As one of the world’s leading brewers, Anheuser-Busch has a variety of different brands and works with a lot of wholesalers and retailers. One of the leading challenges in serving consumers is to ensure product-availability with wholesalers. Based on market research, when consumers notice their favourite brand is missing from the shelves of retailers, they may quickly make the choice for a competitor’s brand instead. 

Understanding the demand of the products in advance, could help the brewers plan better to have good inventory, would in-turn help the wholesalers have enough stock for the retailers to have customers' favourite products on-shelf! With the significant business impact, the goal for the project is to forecast product demand for 5 products for 2 wholesalers for the next 14 days. 


## Solution Approach

## Forecasted demand for 14 days
